# 100 Days Of Code - Trisha's Log

### Day 0: December 10th 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Intro to Python 

**Thoughts:** Python seems familiar to me so I feel I have been exposed to it in the past. I am not completely new to coding. I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript in the past, but I am by no means an expert and would class myself as a 'false beginner'.

### Day 1: December 11th, 

**Today's Progress**: I've completed a small project to create a tip calculator and signed up to the Free Code Camp, where I'm checking out  Dr. Charles Severance (a.k.a. Dr. Chuck) course on Python and Data Science. 

**Thoughts** I am surprised just how many free resources are avaliable for people wishing to learn coding!
